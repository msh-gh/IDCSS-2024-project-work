# IDCSS-2024-project-work
This Repo shows project work done during 7th edition Indo-Ducth CyberSecurity School [2024]  

The IDCSS24 is a joint initiative of Hague Centre for Strategic Studies (HCSS), Data Security Council of 
India (DSCI), the Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence Telangana, the Municipality of The Hague, the 
Embassy of India in The Hague, and the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in New Delhi, 
along with several partner organizations and sponsors. This school is made possible by the Dutch 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

**The school schedule had mainly two parts.**

PART 1
--------
In the first part of the school (October 14th until October 25th) I have attended given 20+ lectures, provided by various experts in the field and from academia. 
These lectures equiped me with strong knowledge on following topics:
Assessment and Penetration Testing 
OT & IIoT Security 
The Role of Artificial 
Intelligence in Cyber Security The strategic nexus between cyber operations and Artificial Intelligence 
The Internet Way of Networking
API Security 
Governance, Risk and Compliance 
Cyber Law 
Privacy Engineering & PETs 
The Quantum Threat to Cryptography 
Identity and Access Management 
Automotive Security 
Introduction to Data Privacy
Governance of the Internet 
EU Legislation

Additionally, three sessions of Strategic Cyber Resilience Game were conducted . The game is played in three 
different phases, some asynchronous and some synchronously with the other players. We move 
through the different phases in three game sessions. 


PART 2
---------
The practical part of the school was started From October 28th until November 8th, We were tasked with working on practical challenges, together with your fellow students.
We were divided into Teams and allotted with specific challenge.

Our challenge overview:
---------------------------
Counter Forensics in Digital Investigations 

Scenario Overview: 
As a digital forensic investigator, youâ€™ve been assigned to a high-profile case involving a suspect known 
for using counter forensic techniques to evade detection. Your goal is to identify and analyze various 
counter forensic methods the suspect may have used, assess their potential impact on the 
investigation, and develop strategies to mitigate these tactics. 
Tasks: 
1. Identify Counter Forensic Technologies 
o List at least three counter forensic tools or techniques (e.g., encryption, steganography, 
anti-forensic wiping) and explain how they work to obstruct forensic analysis. 
2. Case Study Analysis 
o Research a real-world case where counter forensic techniques were employed. 
Summarize the case, detailing how these techniques impacted the investigation, and any 
challenges encountered by investigators. 
3. Impact on Digital Investigations 
o Describe the potential effects of these counter forensic techniques on the integrity and 
efficiency of digital investigations and incident response. Discuss any limitations they 
impose on evidence collection and analysis. 
4. Mitigation Strategies for Investigators 
o Propose at least two best practices or tools that investigators can use to counteract or 
mitigate the impact of counter forensic methods. Describe how these strategies improve 
the chances of successful evidence recovery. 

Deliverable: 
Submit a brief report covering the above tasks, emphasizing how investigators can adapt to evolving 
counter forensic technologies in digital forensics and incident response in a ppt format. 
Create a video snippet not exceeding 3 minutes briefing your presentation. 

Deliverables of this challenge by my team is attached in this github repo.

The 7th Edition Indo-Dutch Cybersecurity School [2024] project has been structured across multiple formats
Word document, 
PowerPoint presentation, 
and YouTube video
ensuring a comprehensive and accessible approach to cybersecurity insights.
